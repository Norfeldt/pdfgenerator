## Code

Here's a snippet of code used in our quantum simulations:

```{.python}
def calculate_wave_function(psi, H, t):
    """
    Solves the time-dependent Schrödinger equation.
    """
    return np.exp(-1j * H * t / hbar) @ psi
```

## Blockquotes

Prof. Zephyr Quark once said:

> The universe is not only stranger than we imagine, it is stranger than we can imagine. Quantum mechanics reveals a reality far more bizarre and wonderful than any science fiction.

His colleague, Dr. Nova Flux, added:

> In the quantum realm, particles dance to the tune of probability waves. What we perceive as solid matter is mostly empty space, filled with fields of possibility.

## Footnotes

The discovery of the Higgs boson[^1] revolutionized our understanding of particle physics.

[^1]: The Higgs boson, often called the "God particle," gives mass to other particles.

## Definition Lists

Quantum Superposition
: A principle in quantum mechanics where a particle exists in multiple states simultaneously until observed

Entanglement
: A phenomenon where particles become interconnected and the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently

Dr. Aurora Quasar's latest paper, "Quantum Tunneling in Curved Spacetime," explores the intersection of quantum mechanics and general relativity. She posits that quantum effects near black holes could lead to information preservation, potentially resolving the black hole information paradox.

The Interstellar Quantum Research Institute (IQRI) has announced plans for a new particle accelerator that will dwarf the Large Hadron Collider. This massive undertaking, dubbed "The Cosmic Loop," aims to recreate conditions similar to those microseconds after the Big Bang.

As we delve deeper into the quantum realm, we find that reality becomes increasingly bizarre and counterintuitive. The classical laws of physics break down, and we enter a world where probability reigns supreme. It is in this strange and wonderful domain that we hope to uncover the deepest secrets of the universe.
